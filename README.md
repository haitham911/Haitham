Haitham Rageh | GitHub Profile
üëã Hello! I'm Haitham Rageh, a seasoned software engineer passionate about creating elegant solutions and pushing the boundaries of technology. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

About Me
I bring 7+ years of experience to the world of software development, specializing in Golang, microservices architecture, and cloud-native applications. My journey in the tech world has led me to contribute meaningfully to a variety of projects and collaborate with diverse teams.

üî≠ Current Focus
Right now, I'm deeply immersed in building clean and scalable Golang services that harness the power of microservices. I thrive on crafting efficient RESTful and gRPC-based APIs while leveraging cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). My recent projects reflect my commitment to staying at the forefront of modern software development practices.

üåü Highlights
Notiontheory - As a Systems Engineering Lead, I've been instrumental in designing Kubernetes platforms, optimizing microservices communication with gRPC, and implementing cloud operations for monitoring and debugging.

GlassWall - During my time here, I played a pivotal role as a Golang Developer, contributing to high-performance applications built on Kubernetes, Docker, and a range of cutting-edge technologies.

Compu Solutions USA - My role as a Fullstack Developer allowed me to create user-facing applications using Vue.js and develop RESTful web services, enriching my expertise in frontend and backend development.

üöÄ Interests
I'm fascinated by the potential of Kubernetes and Docker in shaping the future of deployment and scaling. My passion for building efficient cloud-native applications has also led me to explore the intricacies of microservices architecture.
